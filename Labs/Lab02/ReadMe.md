## Lab02:

6/7/2020

in this lab, we created a basic HTML page, wiht some style on it, and added a small quiz with 5 question about myself to test the user.

we used `promit()` function in javaScript to pop out a questions to the user, then gives him an `alert()` to tell him which if his answer was correct or wrong.

## Lab03:

7/7/2020

in this lab we modified Lab02 and added another two questions to it. the first question was to guess a random number and the user have 4 chances to get it we used `for` loop to get that.

the second question was to guess one of three choices that was stored in an array.
